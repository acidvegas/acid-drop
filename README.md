# Work in progress
This is a custom firmware being developed for the [LilyGo T-Deck](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-deck), currently it is experimental & buggy.

I am terrible at C++ and still am trying to wrap my head around the language's logic, so most of this code has been shit out and written like a cowboy.

The project started out with as IRC bridge for [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) over MQTT, just so I could say "we have IRC over radio", which later led to me modifying the official Meshtastic [firmware](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware) to add extended features. I am deep in the rabbit hole of embedded development and am starting from scratch making this an entirely custom firmware.

This is being developed in my free time as a fun project. It is no where near being useful.

A compiled "release" will be done once I finish somoe fo the basic features, but feel free t compile this on your own to test it out!

# Previews

# Flashing the Firmware
###### Using VS Code
1. Add your user to the `dialout` group: `sudo gpasswd -a YOURUSERNAME dialout` *(You will need to re-login after adding your user to the `dialout` group for it to take affect)*
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install the [PlatformIO plugin](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
4. Hold down the trackball on the device, turn it on, and plug it in to the computer.
5. Press **F1** and select `PlatformIO: Build`
6. Press **F1** and select `PlatformIO: Upload`
7. Press the RST *(reset)* button ont he device.

###### Using ESP Tool
1. Take the `firmware.bin` file from the release page and download it. *(no releases yet, we still building)*
2. Install [esptool](https://pypi.org/project/esptool/): `pip install esptool`
3. Hold down the trackball on the device, turn it on, and plug it in to the computer.
4. Confirm the serial device in your `/dev` directory *(Your device will likely be `/dev/ttyAMC0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`)*
5. Flash the device: `esptool.py --chip esp32-s3 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware.bin`
6. Press the RST *(reset)* button ont he device.

# Connecting to WiFi
The device will scan for WiFi networks on boot. Once the list is displayed, you can scroll up and down the list with the "u" key for UP and the "d" key for down.

# Commands
| Command         | Description                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/debug`        | Show hardware information   |
| `/me <message>` | Send an ACTION message      |
| `/nick <new>`   | Change your NICK on IRC     |
| `/raw <data>`   | Send RAW data to the server |

# Debugging over Serial
1. Install screen: `apt-get install screen` *(or whatever package manager you use)*
2. Plug in your device via USB.
2. Turn the device on, and run: `screen /dev/ttyAMC0 9600` *(again, this can also be /dev/ttyUSB0)*

# Known issues
- Messages that exceed the screen width and wrap to the next line will throw off thje logic of calculating the max lines able to be displayed on the screen. Messages eventually go off screen.
- Input messages exceeding the screen width go off screen, and need to wrap and create a new input line, pushing up the backlog of messages.
- Some colors are not working when its only a background color or only contains a space
- Sometimes it will not connect to IRC even from reconnections, and you have to reboot and try again.
- Screen timeout can occur during an IRC reconnection and blck keyboard input
